.. _overview:

The two main ways to work with DeFiPy are the Primitive API and the Abstract API.

Primitive Interface
--------------------------

As DeFiPy serves to refactor various DeFi (solidity) frameworks to analyze mock DeFi setups using Python, we've done our best to maintain the integrity of the original solidity interface in the pythonized verion that we offer. This option is best suited for solidity developers who are familiar with working with solidity interface, and want to use DeFiPy as an additional support resource.


Abstract Interface
--------------------------

This option is best suited for analysts who want to streamline their work to implement DeFi analytics on the various protocols.
