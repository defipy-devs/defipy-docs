📝 Commercial Rights FAQ
---------------------------------------

This FAQ explains the commercial usage rights and restrictions related to the DeFiPy project, including its related components such as protocol packages (e.g., `uniswappy`, `balancerpy`, `stableswappy`), Web3Scout, and future agent systems.

🔓 **What license is DeFiPy distributed under?**

DeFiPy is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. This is a permissive open-source license that allows broad usage rights, including for commercial purposes, as long as attribution and other license terms are followed.


💼 **Can I use DeFiPy in a commercial product?**

**Yes.** You can use DeFiPy in proprietary or commercial products, SaaS tools, trading systems, dashboards, and more — provided you comply with the Apache 2.0 license, including:

- Retaining the original license and copyright
- Including the NOTICE file (if applicable)
- Avoiding trademark misuse


🚫 **What can I NOT do?**

You may **not**:

- **Remove or alter** license headers or required attribution
- **Re-license DeFiPy under more restrictive terms** (e.g., BUSL, GPL) as if it were your own
- **Claim ownership or exclusivity** over DeFiPy or its official packages
- **Mislead users** about the origin or authorship of the code



🤖 **Can I fork DeFiPy and build my own DeFi agent system?**

Yes — but you must comply with the Apache 2.0 license. You can:

- Fork the repo
- Extend the agent framework
- Build your own agents

However, you **must retain attribution** and **cannot misrepresent** your fork as the official DeFiPy project.


🔁 **Can I resell or offer paid access to a service built on DeFiPy?**

Yes — for example, you may:

- Use DeFiPy in a hosted analytics dashboard
- Build trading tools or bots powered by DeFiPy
- Offer commercial API access to processed data

You may do this **without needing a special license**, as long as you're not misrepresenting the code’s origin or violating any Apache 2.0 terms.


🧑‍💻 **Can I contribute to DeFiPy and use those contributions commercially?**

Yes — contributions are welcome. By contributing, you agree to license your work under the Apache 2.0 License. This allows both you and others (including the DeFiPy core team) to use it in commercial and open-source projects.


🧠 **Who owns DeFiPy?**

DeFiPy is an open-source project led by Ian Moore and maintained under the GitHub organization `defipy-devs <https://github.com/defipy-devs>`_. Contributions are welcome under the Apache 2.0 license. Attribution and trademark guidelines should be followed.


🛡️ **Is the name “DeFiPy” protected?**

Yes. While DeFiPy is open-source, the **name, logo, and brand** are protected to avoid confusion. Use of the DeFiPy name in derivative or commercial projects must not imply affiliation or endorsement unless approved.

See `TRADEMARK.md` (coming soon) for more info.
