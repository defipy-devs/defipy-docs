</ol>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of
any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
